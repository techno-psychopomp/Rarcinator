## Getting Started

To start using Rarcinator, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an environment variable and reference to it in `rarcinatorpy` (I used `OPENAI_API_KEY'` in this example so replace if needed)
3.Replace `your-repository`, `your-branch`, `your-access-token`, `your-username` in generate_mr.sh with your Github information.
4. Run the script on the file you want to check for grammar/spelling
```
# run the script on a HTML file
 python rarcinator.py index.html
```


## RoadMap
- Support for multiple files: Be able to scan the hole repository or a selection of files.
